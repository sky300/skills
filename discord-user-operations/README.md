# Discord User Operations

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

Discord User Operations is a skill for reading, searching, and writing on Discord as a regular user account.

## What It Does

- reads servers, channels, forum threads, and message history
- searches server messages by content, author, channel, and date range
- replies to threads, edits and deletes your own messages
- adds reactions, reads pinned messages, and handles DMs
- covers two access paths: direct HTTP and a logged-in browser session
- documents the REST API mechanics that matter: authentication, snowflakes, rate limits, and error semantics
- ships **no code**: every environment-dependent choice is written as a decision for the agent

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add https://git.nite07.com/nite/skills.git -g -s discord-user-operations
```

## Requirements

- **Access Path A (direct HTTP):** any HTTP client and the user's token. No
  browser, no packages.
- **Access Path B (browser session):** a browser tool you can drive that reaches a
  logged-in Discord session — navigate, evaluate JS, and either the user's own
  logged-in profile or a way to inject their stored token. The agent decides
  whether it has one from its own toolset; when it does not,
  [`references/browser-tool-setup.md`](./references/browser-tool-setup.md) explains
  how to stand one up (CloakBrowser kernel behind Playwright MCP, with the storage
  tools Path B needs) — as instructions to adapt, not a script to run.

## When To Use It

Use this skill when you want to:

- browse Discord servers and forum threads as yourself
- read channel history or search for specific messages
- reply to a thread, or edit something you posted
- add a reaction, check pinned messages, or handle a DM
- handle small, personal Discord tasks through your own account

## How To Use It

1. Provide a target:
   - a server, channel, or thread
   - a message to reply to or edit
2. Say what you want:
   - a read or a search
   - a drafted reply or edit
   - a reaction, a pin lookup, or a DM
3. For anything visible to others, review the exact content before it is sent.
4. After a write, re-read the target to verify the result.

## Example Requests

```text
Read the latest messages in this channel and summarize them.

Search this server for messages about the launch from the last week.

Draft a reply to this thread and post it once I confirm.

Edit my last message to fix the wording.
```

## Notes

- Built for personal, low-frequency, read-mostly use — not bulk actions or automated outreach.
- User-token automation sits in a gray area under Discord's Terms of Service: keep it considerate.
- Anything visible to others requires explicit confirmation before it is sent.
- Treat your token like a password: never paste it into chats, logs, or commits.
