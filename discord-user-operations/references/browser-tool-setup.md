# Giving the agent a browser tool (text guidance)

Access Path B in this skill assumes you can drive a browser that is logged into
Discord. This page is for when you cannot — either because you have no browser
tool at all, or no way to get the user's session into it.

**Nothing here depends on code running.** It is instructions to adapt to the
machine in front of you, because only you can see its constraints (OS, WSL or
not, what is installed, which MCP client is in play).

## What Path B actually needs

Three things, no more:

1. **Navigate** to a `discord.com` URL and get the rendered page.
2. **Evaluate JS** in that page (the DOM reads, and the same-origin `fetch` that
   does all the writes).
3. **A session**: a profile already logged in as the user, or a way to inject the
   stored Discord token / storage state — a cookie-and-storage tool, a
   storage-state file, CDP, or the user's own logged-in profile.

Any implementation with those three works. Decide from your own toolset: if you
already have such a tool, skip this page. If you do not, do **not** improvise —
set one up (below) or ask the user for one.

## Variant A — CloakBrowser kernel behind Playwright MCP (recommended)

Discord web is tolerant, but a stock automation browser still shows the usual
signals (`navigator.webdriver = true`, empty plugin list, mismatched TLS
fingerprint). CloakBrowser is an anti-detect Chromium build; Playwright MCP is
the entry point, and its `--caps=storage` flag is what provides the
cookie/storage tools Path B relies on.

**1. Install the kernel.** The exact path matters later, so read it back:

```bash
uv tool install cloakbrowser      # or: pipx install cloakbrowser
cloakbrowser install              # downloads the browser binary
cloakbrowser info                 # prints the kernel path — copy it
```

If `uv`/`pipx` are unavailable, any install route works as long as
`cloakbrowser install` runs and reports a path.

**2. Point Playwright MCP at it.** Config file — write it wherever *your* client
keeps MCP configs; check its docs rather than assuming. (Example only: a Hermes
install reads its own config from `~/.hermes/playwright-mcp/config.json` — do not
copy that path if you are not on Hermes.) Note the path you chose for step 3:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "browserName": "chromium",
    "launchOptions": {
      "executablePath": "<path reported by cloakbrowser info>"
    }
  },
  "outputDir": "<any writable directory>"
}
```

Both values are placeholders on purpose — where the browser and its output live
is this machine's decision, not the skill's. Fill them from `cloakbrowser info`
on Linux, the app bundle on macOS, `...\chrome.exe` on Windows.

**3. Register the MCP server with the agent.** Hermes example — the flags are the
part that generalises:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  playwright-cloak:
    enabled: true
    command: npx
    args:
      - "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      - "--caps=storage"     # ← the flag that provides the storage tools
      - "--config"
      - "<path to the config file from step 2>"
      - "--headless"
```

`--caps=storage` adds what Path B needs:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `browser_storage_state` / `browser_set_storage_state` | save and restore the session (this is how the Discord token arrives) |
| `browser_cookie_set` / `get` / `list` / `delete` / `clear` | manage individual cookies |

**4. Verify** before touching Discord:

```bash
hermes mcp test playwright-cloak     # expect: ✓ Connected / ✓ Tools discovered
```

A server that connects but exposes no storage/cookie tools means `--caps=storage`
did not take effect — fix that first, because loading the session is the point.

## Variant B — Windows/WSL split

If the agent runs inside WSL but a Windows browser is the better citizen (no WSL
graphics/GPU/Turnstile pain), keep Playwright MCP and the browser on the Windows
side: put the config on Windows
(`C:\Users\<username>\.hermes\playwright-mcp\config.json`), point
`executablePath` at `.../chromium-<version>/chrome.exe`, and let the WSL-side
agent drive it. Do **not** point the agent's `command` straight at
`/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npx` — child processes started that way can lose
their environment; use the wrapper form the guide prescribes.

## Variant C — no CloakBrowser: plain Playwright

Acceptable when CloakBrowser cannot be installed at all:

```bash
uvx --with playwright playwright install chromium
```

Playwright then resolves its own browser — there is no path to configure. If you
do want an explicit binary, ask Playwright where its browser lives on this machine
rather than assuming a location:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
pw = sync_playwright().start()
print(pw.chromium.executable_path)
pw.stop()
PY
```

Either form works — what matters is that the session reaches the browser, not
where the binary lives.

## After the tool exists

1. Load the user's Discord session into it: a logged-in profile, or a
   storage-state file containing the `token` entry for the `https://discord.com`
   origin. Unwrapping details: `browser-session-details.md`.
2. Open `https://discord.com` and confirm you see the app shell rather than a
   login screen — that is the session check; no code needed.
3. Continue with `browser-session-details.md` (DOM reads, same-origin `fetch` for
   writes).

## If the setup fails

- **Report what you tried and where it stopped.** Do not silently fall back to a
  half-working path: reading the page without a session yields a login screen, and
  presenting that as data is worse than saying "no browser session available".
- **The direct-HTTP path still works.** If the user can supply their token, Access
  Path A needs no browser at all — that is often the faster unblock, and it is
  worth offering before spending turns on browser setup.
- **Never invent kernel paths.** If `cloakbrowser info` cannot be run, leave the
  placeholder and ask the user, or check for an existing install
  (`~/.cloakbrowser/chromium-*/chrome`).
- **One browser is enough.** If the agent already has a cookie-capable browser
  tool (cloak, Playwright MCP, browser-use, a CDP-attached Chromium), use it and
  skip this page entirely.
